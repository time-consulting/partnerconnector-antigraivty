URGENT: Partner/normal user pages are now blank (Track Deals + user pipeline), but admin pages still work.

We need a focused debug to find the exact crash and fix it.

PHASE 1 — REPRO + CAPTURE PROOF
1) Reproduce as a normal user:
- Open /track-deals (and any other partner pipeline route)
- Confirm it renders blank.

2) Capture and paste:
- Browser Console errors (full stack trace)
- Network tab: failed requests on page load (status codes + URLs)
- Server logs during the request (auth/session errors, API errors)

PHASE 2 — ISOLATE ROOT CAUSE
3) Identify exactly what component is crashing for partner view:
- Is it track-deals.tsx rendering error?
- Is it UnifiedDealModal / ProgressTracker / a shared layout error?
- Is it a missing field on partner data that admin data has?

4) Check for role/viewMode changes introduced recently:
- Any code that expects admin-only fields in partner pages
- Any condition using user.isAdmin or viewMode that might now be undefined
- Any imports changed in Payments styling that affect shared components (nav/sidebar/routes)

PHASE 3 — VERIFY PARTNER API DATA SHAPE
5) Verify partner endpoint returns valid data:
- Call GET /api/deals/with-quotes as the normal user
- Confirm response is 200 and contains expected fields (dealStage, businessName/tradingName, productType, quote, signupCompletedAt)
- If 401/403 -> auth/session issue
- If 500 -> server query issue

PHASE 4 — FIX (MINIMAL)
6) Fix the exact file/line causing the blank screen.
Common quick fixes:
- Add null guards for missing deal fields in partner view
- Fix broken import/export that only partner route uses
- Ensure partner routes do not import admin-only components
- Restore correct router mapping to partner pages

PHASE 5 — SAFETY
7) Add an ErrorBoundary around partner routes so future errors show a visible error panel instead of a blank screen.

DELIVERABLES
- The exact console error + file/line number
- Files changed
- Confirmation that partner pages render again (Track Deals + user pipeline)
- Then we can safely return to Payments styling
