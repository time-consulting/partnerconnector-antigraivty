📘 Partner Connect Training – Dojo LTR & Statement Handling
1. What is LTR?

LTR = Lifetime Rate

Calculated using a customer’s card payment statement.

Essential for:

Showing how Dojo reduces costs.

Verifying turnover.

Spotting high-risk/restricted category businesses.

💡 Best Practice:
Always get a statement before making an offer. If needed, help the customer log in to their provider’s portal or request a copy.

2. Why Statements Matter

Trust: Statements prove the true cost, turnover, and provider setup.

Accuracy: Prevents quoting the wrong rate.

Conversion: Make the offer while the statement is open → higher chance of sign-up.

3. Switcher Statement Comparison

Once you have the statement, compare the customer’s current fees with Dojo’s offer.

Highlight:

Per-transaction savings.

Monthly fixed fee reductions.

Faster settlement (Dojo = next-day).
