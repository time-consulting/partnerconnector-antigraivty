I need you to structure the full pipeline flow for quote submissions between Accountants (User Side) and Admin (My Side). Build the data model, routes, UI screens, and explain what should happen at each stage. Here is the exact flow:

🟦 USER SIDE (ACCOUNTANT PORTAL)
1. “Submit Quote” Page

Accountant fills in:

Business Name

Contact Name

Phone

Email

Product Needed (Card Payments, Booking System, Funding, Marketing)

Notes / File Upload

Button:

Submit Quote

When clicked:

Creates a new record in DB with status = "quote_request"

Visible in Admin Portal under Quote Requests

Visible in User Portal under Submitted Quotes

2. “Quotes Received” Page

This page shows quotes after admin creates them.

Each quote card shows:

Quote Reference

Status

PDF / Price / Details

Admin Notes

Buttons (for accountant):

Approve Quote

Send to Client (optional)

Reject Quote

Status changes:

Approve Quote → status "approved_waiting_client"
