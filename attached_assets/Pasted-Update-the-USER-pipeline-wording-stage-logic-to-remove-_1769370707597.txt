Update the USER pipeline wording + stage logic to remove confusion around “Approved”.

Decision:
- “Approved” must ONLY mean Dojo approved (terminals dispatched / before live).
- The user stage after quote is accepted + signup completed should be named “Application Submitted”.
- Deal should only show “Application Submitted” AFTER the user completes the signup application form.

A) USER TAB NAMES (IN ORDER)
1) All Deals
2) Submitted
3) Quote Received
4) Application Submitted
5) In Progress
6) Approved (Dojo Approved)
7) Live
8) Complete
9) Declined

B) TAB -> CANONICAL FILTER MAPPING (BASED ON deals.dealStage + signupCompletedAt)
Submitted =
  dealStage in ['submitted','quote_request_received']

Quote Received =
  dealStage in ['quote_sent']

Application Submitted =
  signupCompletedAt IS NOT NULL
  AND dealStage in ['signup_submitted','agreement_sent','signed_awaiting_docs','under_review']
  (or whichever stages represent post-signup, pre-Dojo approval)

In Progress =
  dealStage in ['agreement_sent','signed_awaiting_docs','under_review']
  (exclude Dojo approved + later)

Approved (Dojo Approved) =
  dealStage in ['approved','approved_dispatching','delivered_pending_live']
  Label to user: "Approved (Terminals on the way)"

Live =
  dealStage in ['live','live_confirm_ltr']

Complete =
  dealStage in ['invoice_received','completed','commission_posted','paid_out'] (use the ones that exist)

Declined =
  dealStage in ['declined']

IMPORTANT BEHAVIOUR:
- After user completes signup application, set:
  signupCompletedAt = now()
  dealStage = 'signup_submitted'
- Do NOT show “Application Submitted” unless signupCompletedAt is set.
- Do NOT call anything “Approved” until Dojo approval stage.

C) UI CLEANUP
- Remove any user UI label "Approved – Sign Up"
- Ensure there is no duplicate "Approved" meaning across tabs.
- Ensure pipeline renders from a single config (dealWorkflow.ts or userWorkflow.ts) with no hardcoded arrays in components.

D) SECURITY
- Confirm user endpoints always scope deals by referrer_id server-side.
- Confirm messaging endpoints enforce ownership.

Deliverables:
- files changed
- updated user tab labels + mapping table
- confirmation that complete-signup sets dealStage='signup_submitted'
- screenshot or console proof that user pipeline shows the new tabs in order
