We have a regression: user can view the quote but the CTA buttons (Approve Quote + Complete Sign Up form) no longer render. Previously we also had "Send to client" and "Request lower rates" buttons.

Do NOT guess. Trace the exact UI logic.

1) Find the Quote View component(s) where buttons should appear.
   - Identify the conditional logic controlling each CTA render.
   - Log/print the values used in conditions:
     deal.deal_stage, deal.status, quote.status, quote.approved_at, quote.sent_at, user role (admin/client), and any flags.

2) Identify what changed after card/ID logic updates:
   - Is the quote object shape different (missing fields)?
   - Is the stage value different (e.g., moved into quote stages)?
   - Is the role check failing (client vs admin)?
   - Are we querying the wrong deal/quote relationship?

3) Restore the CTA behaviour with a clear contract:
   Client CTAs:
     - Approve Quote (available when quote is sent and not yet approved)
     - Request lower rates (available when quote is sent and not yet approved)
     - Complete sign-up (available after client approves quote OR after agreement sent, depending on our rule)
   Admin CTAs:
     - Send to client (available when quote exists and not yet sent)
     - Mark agreement sent / request docs / mark live etc.

4) IMPORTANT: Do not use deal_stage solely for menu filtering. Implement:
   - action_required_by: 'client' | 'admin' | 'none'
   - action_required_type: e.g. 'approve_quote' | 'submit_signup' | 'upload_docs'
   Update this whenever stage changes or key actions happen.

5) Update the sidebar/menu:
   - "Quotes requiring action" should be a FILTER:
     action_required_by='client' AND action_required_type in ('approve_quote','submit_signup')
   Not a stage.

6) Add regression checklist:
   - Quote sent -> client sees Approve + Request lower rates
   - Client approves -> client sees Sign-up form CTA
   - Client submits sign-up -> admin sees docs/next-step CTA
   - Admin marks live -> client sees live confirmation
Return: files changed + exact condition rules.
