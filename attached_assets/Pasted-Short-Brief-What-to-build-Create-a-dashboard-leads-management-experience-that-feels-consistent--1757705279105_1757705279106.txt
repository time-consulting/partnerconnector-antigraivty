Short Brief (What to build)

Create a dashboard + leads management experience that feels consistent with our black/blue/white theme.

Use a left side menu only (remove top menu on desktop to avoid duplicates).

Make everything simple, fast, and mobile-friendly.

Objectives

Clarity at a glance: Users should instantly see key stats and what to do next.

Fast lead actions: Add, update, request quote, and move stages with minimal clicks.

Growth-first: “Invite/Add team member” is prominent and easy.

Consistency: Same look/feel, spacing, buttons, and interactions across pages.

Navigation & Layout

Keep a collapsible left sidebar for main navigation.

Dashboard is the home. Leads is a dedicated page.

On mobile, the sidebar collapses into a hamburger; content remains the focus.

Dashboard (reference for style consistency)

Top: greeting + 3 snapshot cards (Deals Submitted, Commission Pending, Referrals Made).

Prominent Add Team Member button near the top.

Quick Actions: Submit a deal, Track a referral, View payout history.

Below: Tasks, Recent referrals, Suggestions.

Leads Management (Kanban CRM)

Show a pipeline board with these columns (in order):

My Leads → Contacted → Submitted → Quote Received → Agreed

Each lead is a card showing: name, business, small stage badge, and quick actions.

Drag and drop to move cards between stages.

Click a card to open a clean details panel with:

Editable contact fields

Notes (timeline)

Activity history

Request Quote button

Add a small kebab (⋮) menu on the card for Delete with confirmation.

Search bar at the top filters live by name, business, email, phone.

Request Quote Flow (smooth, in one place)

Pressing Request Quote opens a simple pop-up on the same page.

Pre-fill known info; clearly mark anything missing.

Submitting:

Creates a referral for the admin team

Automatically moves the card to “Submitted”

Shows a clear success message

Uploading/Adding Leads

Primary Add Lead button opens a simple, clean form.

Only ask for essentials first; allow editing more details later in the lead panel.

The new lead appears in My Leads.

Mobile Experience

Columns slide horizontally (swipe/scroll) so it fits on small screens.

Sticky top bar with Search and Add Lead.

Tap targets are large and easy; pop-ups fit mobile.

Admin Handoff (smooth submission → quote → approval)

When a user submits a quote request:

Admins receive it in their queue

Admins can acknowledge, ask for missing info, and attach a quote

User sees the lead move to Quote Received and can Accept to move to Agreed

Permissions & Safety

Users see only their own leads; admins see all.

Every change is logged in an activity trail for that lead.

Delete asks for confirmation and can be undone by an admin (soft delete is fine).

Consistency & Look

Use the same theme as the dashboard: black background, blue accents, clean white text.

Keep spacing, button styles, and hover states consistent.

Subtle glow on active/hover elements is OK; keep it tasteful.

Performance & Feedback

The board should feel instant: show quick loading states, instant visual updates, and friendly toasts.

Large boards should still scroll smoothly; avoid clutter.

Success Criteria (how we’ll know it’s right)

I can add a lead, drag it across stages, open it, add notes, request a quote, and see it move to Submitted — all easily, without leaving the page.

Search finds the right leads as I type.

On mobile, I can swipe between columns and still access all actions.

The style matches the dashboard and there’s only one navigation menu (left side).
